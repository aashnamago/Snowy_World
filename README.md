# Snowy_World
Unity Project -- Snowy World originally designed for viewing on iPhone using 3D-printed VR2GO viewer (http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/diy/vr2go/). On iOS devices, use volume buttons to move backwards and forwards in the world and tilt device to determine direction of movement. 

Can also build project for Oculus Rift and use arrow keys to move around.
